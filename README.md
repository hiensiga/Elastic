### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build Alamofire 4.0+.

To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Alamofire', '4.8.0'
```

Then, run the following command:
```bash
$ pod install
```
